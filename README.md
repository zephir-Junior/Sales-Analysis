## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sales data using Microsoft Excel. The analysis covers descriptive statistics, data visualization, and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to extract valuable insights from the data to inform business decisions and improve sales performance.

#### 1- How to use descriptive statistics methods to assess the sales performance across various segments, markets, product categories and subcategories?
#### 2- How to use diagnostic analytics methods to understand the statistical significance of the factors that influence sales?
#### 3- How to use predictive analytics (regression) to understand the strengths of the relationship between sales and sales drivers and generate a regression formula to predict sales?
#### 4- How to develop a sales forecasting model based on the insights?
